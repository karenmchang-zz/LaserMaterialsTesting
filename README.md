\f0\fs24 \cf0 Laser Materials Testing\
\
Cole and I tested the same acrylic sheets together. \
We both had free samples (white and red) from an online store called Plaskolite (www.plaskolite.com)\
\
For the settings, we had no idea where to start because we were the first to try the laser cutter. Therefore, we started with the suggested setting for acrylic. Which were - Power: 100, Speed: 1.00, Hz: 6000. These settings worked perfectly. \
For fun though, we attempted more settings such as - Power 80, Speed:10, Hz: 6000  and Power:50, Speed:50, Hz:6000.\
\
The second set of settings almost cut all the way through but it took some effort to pop the piece out. And the third set of settings did not cut all the way through but instead engraved. \
